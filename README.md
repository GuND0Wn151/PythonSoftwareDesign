# Python Software Design
A collection of examples of how to apply various software design patterns in Python.

It is primarily focused around Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Introduction

### TL;DR
There are too many beginner tutorials for Python, but few tutorials teaching design patterns and best-practices in Python. This repository is a resource for Python developers looking to enhance their skills, and ultimately write better software.

### Inspiration
This project is hugely inspired by [ArjanCodes](https://www.youtube.com/@ArjanCodes) and [Dive into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book) by Alexander Shvets.

Please check out their work and support them, because this project wouldn't exist if it wasn't for their amazing content (not sponsored).

### What?
This is a collection of various best-practices, design patterns, anti-patterns, and other useful code examples in Python. It's main goal is to make design patterns in Python approachable and easy to understand. It's here to turn Python "scripters" into Python "developers".

If you find yourself wanting to not just write code that works, but code that:
 - works _well_
 - is easy for other people to understand
 - is easy to update and modify
 - stays clean, even as your project grows
